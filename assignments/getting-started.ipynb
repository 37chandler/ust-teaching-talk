    "## Market Clustering Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you'll explore how clustering can help improve our car pricing models. Building on our previous work with individual location models, you'll investigate whether grouping similar markets together provides a better balance of accuracy and coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Goals\n",
    "1. Compare different approaches to market clustering\n",
    "2. Evaluate the tradeoff between model granularity and accuracy\n",
    "3. Make a data-driven recommendation for clustering strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "1. Try three different cluster sizes (e.g., 5, 8, 12 clusters)\n",
    "2. For each clustering:\n",
    "   - Build pricing models for each cluster\n",
    "   - Compare accuracy to national model\n",
    "   - Analyze coverage vs individual market approach\n",
    "3. Make a recommendation supported by:\n",
    "   - Quantitative metrics (accuracy, coverage)\n",
    "   - Visualizations showing cluster characteristics\n",
    "   - Clear explanation of tradeoffs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips\n",
    "- Start by exploring what makes markets \"similar\"\n",
    "- Consider different features for clustering\n",
    "- Think about how to handle categorical variables\n",
    "- Pay attention to missing data\n",
